## About the Game

Snake is a simple yet engaging game where the player maneuvers a line (the snake) which grows in length with each point or "food" it consumes. The primary objective of the game is to control the snake and help it eat as much food as possible. However, the game ends if the snake collides with the game boundary or with its own tail. This Python version of Snake aims to recapture the thrill and excitement of the classic game.
